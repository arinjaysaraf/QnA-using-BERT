# Q&A NLP Application using BERT

- This is an NLP-powered Question Answering web application (Q&A) that employs the state-of-the-art, BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.
- Created an interface to accept a passage and a question related to that paragraph as input.
- Developed using ReactJs and TensorflowJs.

## Description

- It employs Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relationships between words (or sub-words) in a text.
- The BERT model integrated in this application can answer usersâ€™ questions in natural language. It was created using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on SQuAD 2.0 dataset by Google.
- The Web Application takes a passage and a question as input, then returns a segment of the passage that most likely answers the question with respective BERT evaluated score.
